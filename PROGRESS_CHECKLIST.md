# Kurzgesagt Video Analysis Project - Progress Checklist

## ‚úÖ Setup & Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Python packages: `pip install openai-whisper yt-dlp pinecone-client langchain openai python-dotenv`
- [ ] Install FFmpeg for audio processing
- [ ] Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- [ ] Get Pinecone API key from https://app.pinecone.io/
- [ ] Create `.env` file with API keys

### API Keys Configuration
```bash
# Add these to your .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key-here
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=gcp-starter
```

## üì• Phase 1: Data Collection

### Audio Download
- [ ] Run `python batch_audio_downloader.py`
- [ ] Select option 1 or 3 (with transcription)
- [ ] Verify ~31 MP3 files in `audio_files/` folder
- [ ] Check file sizes (should be 5-50MB each)

**Expected Files:**
- [ ] Fentanyl.mp3
- [ ] How_The_Immune_System_ACTUALLY_Works_IMMUNE.mp3
- [ ] Vaping.mp3
- [ ] Weed.mp3
- [ ] [... and 27+ more videos]

---

## üìù Phase 2: Transcription

### Text Generation
- [ ] Audio files successfully transcribed to text
- [ ] Verify ~31 TXT files in `transcripts/` folder
- [ ] Check transcript quality (readable sentences)
- [ ] Verify file naming: `{video_title}_transcript.txt`

**Expected Files:**
- [ ] Fentanyl_transcript.txt
- [ ] How_The_Immune_System_ACTUALLY_Works_IMMUNE_transcript.txt
- [ ] Vaping_transcript.txt
- [ ] [... and 27+ more transcripts]

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Phase 3: Vector Database

### Pinecone Index Creation
- [ ] Run `python pinecone_vector_store.py`
- [ ] Index successfully created: "kurzgesagt-transcripts"
- [ ] All transcript files loaded and processed
- [ ] Text split into chunks (~1000 characters each)
- [ ] Embeddings generated and stored in Pinecone
- [ ] Test query runs successfully

**Verification:**
- [ ] Script shows: "‚úì Successfully created vector store with X documents"
- [ ] Test query returns relevant results
- [ ] No error messages during processing

---

## üîç Phase 4: Search Interface

### Query System
- [ ] Run `python query_interface.py`
- [ ] Interactive search interface works
- [ ] Can search for topics like "immune system", "black holes"
- [ ] Results show video titles and content previews
- [ ] Multiple related chunks returned per query

**Test Queries:**
- [ ] "How does the immune system work?"
- [ ] "What are black holes?"
- [ ] "Why haven't we found aliens?"
- [ ] "What happens when you get sick?"

- [ ] No major errors or crashes during operation
- [ ] Response time under 5 seconds for typical queries

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- [ ] **Coverage**: 25+ videos successfully processed
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Search results match query intent 80%+ of time
- [ ] **Performance**: Query response time < 3 seconds
- [ ] **Completeness**: All major topics searchable

### Qualitative Goals
- [ ] Can find information about immune system topics
- [ ] Can discover content about space and black holes
- [ ] Can locate discussions about health effects of drugs
- [ ] Can search for climate change solutions
- [ ] Can explore what-if scenarios and hypotheticals

## üîß Troubleshooting Checklist

### Common Issues
- [ ] **FFmpeg Error**: Installed and in system PATH?
- [ ] **API Key Error**: Correct keys in .env file?
- [ ] **Download Failures**: Network connection stable?
- [ ] **Transcription Slow**: Using appropriate Whisper model size?
- [ ] **Pinecone Errors**: Within free tier limits?
- [ ] **Search No Results**: Vector store built successfully?

### Recovery Steps
- [ ] Check error messages and logs
- [ ] Verify API key validity
- [ ] Restart failed processes from checkpoints
- [ ] Use smaller batch sizes if memory issues
- [ ] Check Pinecone dashboard for index status

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Web Interface**: Create Streamlit app
- [ ] **RAG System**: Add question-answering with GPT
- [ ] **Category Filtering**: Search within specific topics
- [ ] **Export Features**: Save search results
- [ ] **Analytics**: Track popular queries and topics

### Project Enhancement
- [ ] Add more video categories
- [ ] Improve search result ranking
- [ ] Add video timestamp references
- [ ] Create topic clustering analysis
- [ ] Build recommendation system
