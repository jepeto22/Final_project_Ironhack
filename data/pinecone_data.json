These solar flares and coronal mass ejections or CMEs can hit Earth and have serious consequences for humanity. How exactly do they work, how bad could they be and can we prepare for them? While the sun seems pretty solid, it's actually like a very hot ocean. So hot that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei all flowing around each other in a plasma. This plasma is pushed around and shaped by the sun's magnetic field. Similar to how the sun's gravitational field reaches out to the planets and shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity. Magnetism is one part of a dual force, electromagnetism",

On the sun, the plasma made of electrically charged protons and electrons creates a magnetic field as they move and this magnetic field then shapes the flow of particles. They're stuck in a dynamic feedback loop called a dynamo which keeps the sun's magnetic field alive. This magnetic field stores enormous amounts of energy and leaks out over the solar system. It carries with it a constant trickle of solar plasma like a light rain known as the solar wind, creating a sort of space weather. But it isn't always calm and smooth. As the sun's plasma churns and flows around itself, its magnetic field gets all kinked and twisted",

They race through the solar system at the speed of light, sweeping up protons in the solar wind, accelerating them into a high speed solar proton storm.

While even smaller storms can damage satellites, affect radio communication or will be dangerous to astronauts, for people on the surface space weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from the worst effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays high up in the atmosphere, well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to the north and south poles where energetic particles fall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow and creating beautiful auroras. As with any sort of weather, most of the time things are fine. Sometimes there are hurricanes though, or in the case of the sun, solar super storms",

The thunder is a CME, consisting of billions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150 million kilometers between the sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes a shockwave that violently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy into the magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is aligned to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud passes over Earth, it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail.

When this happens near the event horizon of a black hole, one of these particles can fall in, stopping them from annihilating. The escaping particle is Hawking radiation. Ultimately, the mass of this particle must come from the black hole, so over eons black holes will shrink and radiate away. Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole, it's new stuff stealing mass from it. As the black hole shrinks, the Hawking radiation gets stronger, faster and faster, until what's left eventually evaporates in a flash of high energy radiation like a nuclear bomb. And then, nothing. But that won't happen for a long, long time",

The most massive supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies have lifetimes of 10 to the power of 100 years. How long is that? Imagine an hourglass filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe. In only 10 billion years, one single grain of sand falls to the bottom.

It's the perfect drug for dealers. And while we hear a lot about how deadly Fentanyl is, many people it kills are not even Fentanyl addicts. It's truly the dumbest drug to ruin your life for. Let's learn what Fentanyl does to you, what it feels like and why it's so much lame-er than heroin. Pain and pleasure. Maybe the two most important forces that guide our survival are pain and pleasure. Pain may be the most visceral physical experience. A claw ripping your flesh. A bone cracking. Rejection.

Pleasure is what makes life good because it feels, well, amazing. Eating things that are sweet or high-fat, having sex or opening another booster pack with your friends. Anything that makes you feel pleasure makes you want to do it again. These two opposing forces guide you through life. Pain, shout. Stop, this is bad. Pleasure, cheers. More. Do that again. But while they are opposites, they're also linked. Sometimes our body needs to end pain and create pleasure at the same time.

And nature invented a powerful mechanism to achieve this. The mighty opioid receptor. It's like a keyhole on the neurons that control pain and pleasure. If activated, it reduces pain and how much you care about pain and it creates pleasure and good feelings. The details are complex and not relevant for this story. What you need to know is that any molecule that can fit into an opioid receptor like a key is called an opioid.

Decades of heat waves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famines and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an active desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan. It's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out, but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible. So in the near future, it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change",

In this video, we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes, stratospheric aerosol injection. A clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the sun away.

This absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation, and CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while. You can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning. Even in a really cold room, your body emits infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling. So one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket, which is already happening naturally. About 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice, deserts, snow or clouds. More reflection, less energy, less warming",

The explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere, which hung around there for a while. The stuff that's interesting for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide, a nasty smelling and invisible gas. High in the atmosphere, it produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mixed with water and created giant veils. These veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth's surface by roughly 1%.

Black holes were suggested more than a century ago as an abstract solution to equations of gravity. For more than 50 years, they were considered mathematically valid but too absurd to be real. Few believed they actually existed. But scientists kept working on paper and looking at weird things, and then we saw stars being thrown around by invisible titans",

We have evidence for them and they fit our theories. And nowadays, it's kind of common sense to accept them as real. Black holes are extremely elegant and fascinating, but they also created a lot of questions that have traumatized physicists for decades. Singularities literally break our best understanding of physics. They seem to delete information which shouldn't be possible. Gravastars are a relatively new idea without any of those problems. They don't need singularities that break physics or delete information. They solve the puzzles of black holes. But they too create new problems",

Actually, there is a way to find out. Black holes have an event horizon, while gravastars have a physical shell made of matter. Which means that they behave very differently when they smash into each other. The collision of two objects as massive as they are creates huge amounts of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time that travel at the speed of light.

The problem was, these emissions wouldn't stop. For half a million years, they started to dangerously pile up in the atmosphere. About 300,000 years before the asteroid, the Deccan Traps started to vomit lava. This was nothing like a normal eruption. It was a lava flood.

But this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it. So who's right? Well, it's complicated. To slow rapid climate change, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. In 2018, three-quarters of global emissions were released through energy production, namely by burning fossil fuels. Energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around, to putting things big and small together, or heating our homes. Currently, 84% of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels, 33% from oil, 27% from coal and 24% from gas",

Only about 16% of global energy is from lower-emission sources, almost 7% from hydroelectric, 5% from solar, wind, bioenergy, wave, tidal and geothermal combined, and about 4% from nuclear. So we pretty much rely on coal, oil and gas to keep our civilization going, which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them. To have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing humanity back into the Stone Age, one of the most impactful things we can do is to electrify as many sectors as possible.

But there are a few problems making this transition really hard. First of all, in most places in the world, electricity is still generated mostly by burning fossil fuels. And not only that, in the last 20 years, the world's electricity usage increased 73% in absolute terms.

Countries like China, India and South Korea built new reactors, while Germany and Japan have been actively taking their nuclear plants offline.

But while renewables undoubtedly are the future of electricity, they still have their own huge challenges to overcome before they can take over the vast majority of the electricity grid. The main problem is reliability and consistency. It's not always windy and the sun doesn't always shine, especially in the mornings and evenings when humans need the most electricity. The variations between seasons don't make this issue easier. To make renewables reliable and not risk blackouts, we need massive storage capacities where we can save energy collected when the sun or wind are at their peak and release it later when we actually need it",

Epinephrine and cortisol make your heart beat faster and your body ready for action. Dopamine makes you feel happy and relaxed and reduces your appetite. Beta and dolphins reduce pain and stress. Nicotine excites and calms you at the same time. You become more alert and able to focus, your nerves become more sensitive to pleasant sensations, then your whole body relaxes.

The more you smoke, the harder your body tries to push back, which is why nicotine is so addictive. You stop feeling like yourself without it. It's still great, but now you also need it just to feel normal. If that was all smoking did, well that would be kind of okay. Nicotine comes with thousands of different chemical buddies.

First of all, most great neighborhoods would dissolve over time and connected islands would become remote. Then it just may be the nature of civilization to become unsustainable or self-destructive. Humanity is extremely young and we've already flirted with extinction. There are numerous existential risks, cultural, technological and environmental that any civilization has to deal with. And smaller colonies on new planets would likely be less resilient than their home worlds and in bigger danger of dying out. Whenever this happens, this would leave a good island free again for others to rediscover and colonize",

So the idea of enormously big, connected empires may just not be feasible if the galaxy is an ocean where good islands are few and far between.

If we're lucky our journey will go on for a long long time. Speaking of journeys we want to address something in the spirit of transparency. Kotskazak has changed in the last two years.

These cells have up to four different jobs. Let's assign them. Here are the interactions. Now, let's make this understandable. First of all, let's add colors to the jobs.

Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound. They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes.

Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed. On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield, so fighting becomes easier.

In your digestive system the mast cells can cause nausea, cramps and sharp pain as water floods into your intestines and triggers intense diarrhea and vomiting",

In the best case you get a stuffy nose. In the worst case you're suddenly fighting for your life. Mast cells all over your body unload their bonds all at once causing an anaphylactic shock. Your blood loses so much water that your blood pressure drops to dangerous levels. This alone is life threatening. Incommodation with the things going on in your lungs, anaphylaxis is a life or death emergency, often with just a small time window to do anything about it. Allergic reactions truly are no joke. Even the deadliest diseases like Ebola need days to kill you, but your immune system can kill you within a few minutes",

It may improve your attention, concentration, memory, reaction time and endurance. It can reduce anxiety and stress and help you relax and enhance your mood. Nicotine also suppresses hunger, making it easier to maintain or lose weight. And it's simply fun to put a thing in your mouth and get a little kick. Compared to other stimulants, nicotine's effect doesn't come at the same high price for our bodies. It's also crystal clear that vaping is way way less harmful than smoking.

It's just recently been legalised in Germany, and for very good reasons. Compared to legal drugs like alcohol, which will cause one in 20 deaths just this year, cannabis is pretty mild. So to justify harsh prosecution and punishment, its negative effects have been wildly overstated. Naturally, there was a lot of pushback, and here's something went wrong. If you've followed the discourse over the last few years, you might have got the impression that weed has almost only upsides and few, if any, negative side effects.

To be crystal clear, we think prohibition doesn't work and cannabis should be legal, but this also means that we need to treat it as what it is, a drug, with unique upsides and downsides. So, let's take an honest look at some of the latest research together. Weed is getting stronger and stronger. Cannabis' magic juice is tetrahydrocannabinole THC. It docks on your cannabinoid receptors, which affects various brain functions. THC activates some regions and calms down others, creating a fun cocktail of sensations. The more THC, the more intense the high. And people seem to be into higher highs, or at least this is what the market is providing. In the US, Canada and in Europe, the concentration of THC in legal and illegal cannabis products has more than doubled in the last few decades",

However, more potent strains of bread, products like edibles or concentrates with more than 60% THC have become increasingly common, while the share of products with less than 15% THC has declined. Unfortunately, just about every problem weed creates gets worse at higher THC doses. At the same time, more and more people use weed. In the US, more people consumed cannabis daily than alcohol for the first time in 2022. In Canada, 26% of people 16 and older use it up from 22% in 2018. It's not possible to say if legalization is the reason for this, though, since studies are pretty inconsistent and vary massively between different uses",

So today, more people consume more weed than ever before in the last century and it's the strongest it's ever been. What are we seeing as a result of this? Let's start with something that used to get you laughed out of the room, addiction. Weed addiction and withdrawal symptoms. A big narrative about weed is that it's not addictive, or at least not that big of a deal, and for most people this is true. It is clearly shown that the majority handle it well.

The amount of THC, how often you consume, and your age when you start using Cannabis. The more THC, the more often, and the younger you are when you start, the higher your risk.

Heavy users can experience bad moods, feel irritable, restless, paranoid, anxious, and even depressive. In a sad twist of irony, for many addicts it feels like they need weed to fight these symptoms.

If you find yourself using constantly, this can also stunt your development as a person. The numbness dulls bad feelings, making it easy not to deal with them.

Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, but we are not likely to meet it.

Let's go back 20 years to see why today is so different. Between 2000 and 2010, greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24%, three times as much as the increase in the previous decade.

Since 2015, three-quarters of planned coal plants have been cancelled, and 44 countries have committed to stop building them. 10 years ago, that would have seemed like wishful thinking, but today we can say with confidence, coal is dying.

Your neutrophils and macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells",

Instead of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing, we could become the guardians of life and preserve it where we find it. If possible in the wild, if not then in museums, movies and in our minds.

Let's start with the basics. Why isn't the Moon on its way to crash into us already? We know that Earth's gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon, but somehow it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force. But there is no other force countering gravity. Instead, the trick to staying up is a sideways motion that we call an orbit. You see orbits every day. When you throw a ball, it makes a tiny little orbit. The only difference between the ball's orbit and the Moon's is that the ball eventually hits the ground. Basically, the reason is speed",

If there were no air slowing it down, it could orbit forever. And this is what the Moon does. Falling sideways around Earth very fast with no air slowing it down, orbiting Earth every 27 days at 3,600 km an hour. So, for the Moon to just stop in its orbit and plummet to the Earth would break more laws of physics than we have time to explain. So, how do we crash it into Earth? In a nutshell, to change an object's orbit, you need to change its speed, which changes where gravity takes it. But even small changes require enormous forces, which is why all the large objects in the solar system are so stable nowadays",

Months 4 and 5 On Earth, the tides are rapidly growing to about 30 metres, and will be reaching 100 metres in height in a few short weeks. At low tide, the ocean recedes hundreds of kilometres, exposing the continental shelf like vast deserts, while at high tide, walls of water drown agriculture, houses and skyscrapers. And now, almost five months in, the apocalypse has finished its warm-up act. Since the oceans are on average only three kilometres deep, the tides have reached their maximum. Up until now, the water in the oceans could flow, absorbing most of the Moon's gravitational squeezing, but now the Earth itself is really feeling the squeeze of the ever-approaching Moon",

Strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on other planets and moons.

The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to be annoyed. It is the mouse survive but the elephant and dog don't. The answer is size. Size is the most underappreciated regulator of living things.

The volume determines the weight or more accurately, mass of the animal. The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy before you hit the ground and the stronger the impact shock.

Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that serve as a barrier.

If another star came too close to us, its gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like a spoiled toddler, messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets. This isn't some imaginary danger. Some 70,000 years ago, a red dwarf, brown dwarf binary system passed through the Oort Cloud and messed things up. It might even have sent a deadly onslaught of asteroids our way. But it could take two million years until those visitors from the Oort Cloud arrive in the inner solar system. But there's a much bigger problem on the horizon. Gliese 710, a red dwarf with about half the mass of the Sun, is currently headed towards the solar system",

The night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids raining down on the inner solar system. The larger ones could cause dinosaur-level mass extinctions and would be bad for the stock market.

The odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 in the next 5 billion years. Small, but not absurdly so.

If you've ever been stung by a jellyfish, you know it feels like a painful electric jolt. But the pain actually comes from hundreds of nematocysts inside their tentacles, tiny dark guns filled with venom. So how do we get energy from jellyfish? We'll squeeze it out of them with the power of piezoelectricity. Piezoelectricity is an electric charge that builds up in certain solid materials like crystals or bone when you stress and squeeze them. For example, a quartz crystal is made up of positive and negatively charged atoms arranged in repeating pyramid shapes. Their charges usually cancel each other out",

We'll create a ginormous battery from jellyfish by harnessing the hypnotic movements of Nomura's hundreds of long, thin tentacles.

If a medium-sized banana has about 105 canneries, 15 trillion Sahara bananas alone could already feed the world's population for over two months. For the world as a whole, the canneries have all rained bananas, and up to a grand total of 1.2 quintillion canneries. With just one day of banana rain, we could go on feeding everyone on Earth for over 100 years. Of course, in reality, the banana rain would be pretty catastrophic. A banana falling from about 3,000 meters, the height of a mid-altitude rain cloud, would reach a velocity of 240 meters per second and strike the ground with the same kinetic energy you'd get from dropping a bowling ball off a 50-meter building",

Look at this thing, it's really big. Continuing this proud tradition, let's explore the scientific mystery of what would happen to you if Earth suddenly turned into gold. The Midas Pocalypse, based on the ancient tale of King Midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold. Before we can explore this scenario with science, we'll first define the premise. Midas' curse is a very special phenomenon called magic, which allows us to modify physics. So what happens when Midas touches something and it turns to gold? An atom of gold has 79 protons and 118 neutrons in its nucleus",

The electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom and gives gold its chemical properties, like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and bending. So to make not gold into gold, we have to change atoms. Let's say Midas touches a duck. All the light elements like hydrogen, carbon and oxygen gain electrons and protons and neutrons to become gold. Not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive, it's also much too dense. The gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repel each other violently, causing the golden duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of TNT, leaving only gold dust and a very dead Midas. This is clearly not a very good way for Midas' power to work",

Without adding any matter, the gold duck would be a very awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps. This is funky and doesn't explode, which is progress.

Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans. A great place for our nuclear test. We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb, or Tsar Bomber. Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times and its mushel cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky. Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, it's fireball hot enough to burn the rubble. Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once that they could boil away an entire lake",

In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT. A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history. The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor, radioactive nuclei and the remains of very unlucky fish. The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it. The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way, sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world. And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops",

On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to 10 kilometers the second after it's detonated, as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back. But the pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench is enormous. With 11 kilometers of water overhead, being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction. Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when, oddly enough, it starts to shrink.

But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right? Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not. The explosion would vaporize a part of the seafloor and turn a lot of sand into glass, but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves",

Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years, and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different? The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature. The planet is too big. It doesn't care.

While this is scary enough, they have an even more powerful and dark property they might delete the universe itself. Black holes in a nutshell. A black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a tiny space. At their center, gravity is almost infinitely strong and whatever gets too close is ripped into its elementary particles. Not light can escape black holes and so we perceive them as spheres of blackness. If you were to fall into a black hole nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed its outer border, the event horizon.

No matter how fast you try to swim now, the stream will pull you towards certain death. Nothing can escape a black hole waterfall once it gets too close. This border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe. We can't access them unless we're willing to never return. So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes but we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their very edges.

It will take a black hole with a mass of our sun 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.00000001% of its mass. This is happening constantly and unstoppably and as it goes on it speeds up more and more. In the far far future when the last star in the universe has been dead for trillions of years black holes will become tinier and tinier until they evaporate and disappear leaving behind just a bit of radiation.

It's tidally locked so one side experiences a never-ending night and the other an eternal day lit by the stars' dim glow",

About the size of Europe, barely 200 meters at its deepest point, churned by a never-ending storm where hot air meets the frigid winds from the icy outskirts. But below this inhospitable chaos we find calm stability, an ecosystem in almost perfect balance. Let's dive in. Instead of meeting open water we splash into a floating underwater jungle. We know places like this at home. Kelp forests made from seaweeds up to 65 meters long, sheltering countless smaller creatures. On Earth we get abundant white sunlight so our plants evolve to be green, absorbing the most useful red wave lengths for photosynthesis and reflecting away the rest",

They drop their seeds in the few free spaces in the mud. Only death makes room for new life. Big and streamlined teardrop-shaped creatures push through the dark water. They kind of look like fish.

But then it took two billion years to make the step from single cells to multicellular organisms and two billion more for us to appear. Culture, civilization and space travel developed super quickly though. Do things always take that long or was this actually exceptionally fast? Also, passing one step does not mean the next one is guaranteed. Multicellularity evolved over 25 times independently on Earth, but there's only one species that builds spaceships. We don't know how many steps life needs to pass and how long they take to give rise to a technological civilization, but there are probably many and it's likely that on trillions of planets, life has been trying for billions of years",

Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming. Ruins of ancient alien civilizations would be horrible. The best case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile, that Europa's oceans are devoid of life, and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbour only empty oceans hugging dead continents. That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life. Billions of new homes waiting for us to finally arrive.",

But are wormholes real, or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths? If they are real, how do they work, and where can we find them? For most of human history, we thought space was pretty simple. A big, flat stage where the events of the universe unfold.

General relativity is a mathematical theory. It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality. But they are theoretically possible, and there are different kinds. The first kind of wormholes to be theorized were Einstein-Rosenbridgets. They describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe. Let's try to picture them in 2D again. Empty spacetime is flat, but curved by objects on it. If we compress that object, spacetime gets more curved around it. Eventually, spacetime becomes so warped that it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole",

It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out, though, but that's okay. There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a wormhole, we could try to make one. To be traversable and useful, there are a few properties we want a wormhole to have.

Between the fungal towers, there's a carpet of smaller fungi, and a few alien-like primitive plants. No flowers, no leaves, just strange green stalks and fern-like structures that reach your ankles. Around you, the fungal towers rise like pale pillars. Their surface is neither smooth nor rough, but something in between. They're neither wet nor dry, slightly yielding under your touch. Small patches of what might be lichened create splashes of muted greens and yellows on their surfaces. The only animals you can spot are a few insects burrowing into the large mushrooms.

In a nutshell, you actually have two immune systems, the innate and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system was ready when you were born. It mostly consists of general purpose soldiers, we introduced them in the last immune video. The adaptive immune system carries two types of cells, T cells and B cells that are your super weapons and are incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies. These cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy, but once they're ready, they pack a real punch.

All organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts, mostly proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes. You can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces. There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies. Why is this important?

So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces. When a cell connects together with a protein and recognizes it as enemy, it knows that it has to attack.
